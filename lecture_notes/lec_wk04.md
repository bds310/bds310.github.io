### Lecture 7, 4.20.21 

- **Homework 3 (due 4.21); Homework 4 posted**
    - `datetime` 

- **Why is modeling random processes important in Biology?**
    

- **Two approaches to modeling random processes**
    1. Exact calculation of probabilities via theory
    2. Experimental determination of probabilties via repeated simulation




### Lecture 8, 4.22.21

- **Modeling a random process: What is the chance a once in a lifetime event will happen in your lifetime?**
    Comparison of simulation-based method and exact distribution
    
- **Testing whether experimentally observed data adheres to a specific random process**
    *Is my coin fair?*
    *Does an observed photoreceptor distribution in a new species adhere to the same random model in other species?
    
 - **Links to some topics that I may discuss**
 - [Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution)
 - R7 pale vs yellow photoreceptor types)
