### Lecture 9

Discussion of Midterm Course Evaluation <br>
Updates to syllabus for remainder of course

#### Random processes 

- Review of motivation and simulation-based approach.
 
- Hypothesis Testing: Does observed data support underlying random model? <br> ([Chapter 11, Inferential Thinking](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/11/Testing_Hypotheses.html); HW04, Problem 3)

- Summary Procedure for Hypothesis Testing 

   1. Choose a test statistic (e.g. the predicted mean outcome according to model/theory)
   2. Simulate one version of the observed experiment, recording test statistic.
   3. Repeat simulation many times, tracking the test statistic each time.
   4. Compare the distribution of simulated test statistics with observed value.

- Mendel's Pea Experiment (Breakout Rooms).



#### A/B testing via permutation

- What is the probability that two observed sets of data are different? To address this, we test the null hypothesis, that they come from the same underlying distribution.

- Summary Procedure
    1. Choose a test statistic (typically the difference in means between two categories)
    2. Shuffle the labels of the original sample and computer simulated test statistic 
    3. Repeat the shuffling (permutation) many times.
    4. Compare distributions of shuffled test statistics with observed value.
