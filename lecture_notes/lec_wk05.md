### Lectures 9 and 10, 4.27.21, 4.29.21

### Lecture 9

Discussion of Midterm Course Evaluation <br>
Updates to syllabus for remainder of course

#### Random processes 

- Review of motivation and simulation-based approach.
 
- Hypothesis Testing: Does observed data support underlying random model? <br> ([Chapter 11, Inferential Thinking](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/11/Testing_Hypotheses.html); HW04, Problem 3)

- **Summary Procedure for Hypothesis Testing** 

1. Choose a test statistic (e.g. the predicted mean outcome according to model/theory)
2. Simulate one version of the observed experiment, recording test statistic.
3. Repeat simulation many times, tracking the test statistic each time.
4. Compare the distribution of simulated test statistics with observed statistics.

- Mendel's Pea Experiment (Breakout Rooms).



#### Permutation Testing

Permutation methods for performing an A/B comparison. What is the probability that two observed sets of data would come from the same underlying distribution?
Chapter 12 - Inferential Thinking

https://www.jwilber.me/permutationtest/ 


1. Choose a test statistic (typically the difference in means between two categories)

2. Shuffle the labels of the original sample and computer  simulated test statistic

2. Repeat the shuffling (permutation) many times.

4. Compare distributions of shuffled imulated test statistics with the observed test statistics.





 

- **Why is modeling random processes important in Biology?**
    

- **Two approaches to modeling random processes**
    1. Exact calculation of probabilities via theory
    2. Experimental determination of probabilties via repeated simulation

- **What is the chance a once in a lifetime event will happen in your lifetime?**


### Lecture 6, 4.20.21
- **Simulation as a method to test the hypothesis that observed data corresponds to a particular model?**
    *Is my coin fair?*
