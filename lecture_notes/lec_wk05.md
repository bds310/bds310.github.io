## Lectures 9 and 10, 4.27.21, 4.29.21

### Lectures 5 and 7, 4.27.21 

- **Midterm Course Evaluation Discussion**<br>
  **General Plans for second half of the course**

- **Many processes, in biology, in consumer behavior  are modeled as having a component of randomness. Evaluating the model requires simulate random process. Computers are good at - repeating random process again and again.

Last week, we looked at describing random processes, and the end of lecture, and in third problem of homework, we are moving to testing a particular
random model corresponds to the data.


Continuing Hypothesis Testing (Chapter 11, Inferential Thinking; HW04, Problem 3)


- ** Working on Mendel's Pea Experiment in Breakout Rooms.


Summary Procedure for Hypothesis Testing - Does observed data support hypothesis?

1. Choose a test statistic (e.g. the predicted mean outcome according to model/theory)
2. Simulate one version of the observed experiment, recording test statistic.
3. Repeat simulation many times, tracking the test statistic each time.
4. Compare the distribution of simulated test statistics with observed statistics.



#### Permutation Testing

Permutation methods for performing an A/B comparison. What is the probability that two observed sets of data would come from the same underlying distribution?
Chapter 12 - Inferential Thinking

1. Choose a test statistic (typically the difference in means between two categories)

2. Shuffle the labels of the original sample and computer  simulated test statistic

2. Repeat the shuffling (permutation) many times.

4. Compare distributions of shuffled imulated test statistics with the observed test statistics.





 

- **Why is modeling random processes important in Biology?**
    

- **Two approaches to modeling random processes**
    1. Exact calculation of probabilities via theory
    2. Experimental determination of probabilties via repeated simulation

- **What is the chance a once in a lifetime event will happen in your lifetime?**


### Lecture 6, 4.20.21
- **Simulation as a method to test the hypothesis that observed data corresponds to a particular model?**
    *Is my coin fair?*
