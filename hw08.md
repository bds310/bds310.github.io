## Welcome to homework 08!

This week's homework can be split into two separate goals (each with its own sub-goals):
1. Create your own gh-pages website
	a. Create a new repository.
	b. Convert it to a gh-pages website.
	c. Populate your website on your local machine.
2. Further explore the mauna-loa data
	a. Get a repository that we've started for you onto your local machine.
	b. Begin coding on your local computer and using `.py` files.
	c. Determine correlations between data in mauna-loa.

*Note*: This homework assumes that you have successfully installed python and a terminal capable of running github. Completing these requirements will differ depending on your operating system, so please do this individually. That said, if you need help with this, email us!

### 1. Create your own gh-pages website

#### Part A: Creating a new Repository
Go to <a href='https://github.com' target='_blank'>GitHub</a>. If you are logged in to your github account, you should be able to create a new repository by clicking the green button as pictured below:

Once clicked, you will be given options to configure your repository.

Your repository must be of the format `<account-name>.github.io`. In other words, repository should include **the exact same name as your account name**. If my account name were BillyBob, my github website repository will be called `BillyBob.github.io`.

This should be a public repository. No need to include a `README.md`, a `.gitignore`, or to choose a license.

#### Part B: Convert the repository to gh-pages

1. Once the repository is created, you should be able to access it at the link `github.com/username/username.github.io`. If my username were `BillyBob`, the website would be `github.com/BillyBob/BillyBob.github.io`. 

2. Once at that URL, you should be able to click on the `Settings` Tab (with a gear icon).

3. In the `Settings` Tab, click on the `Pages` Icon under the `Code and Automation` section on the left of the screen.

4. Check to see if your screen matches the image below. Click on the button that says `change theme`. Choose whatever theme you like the most.

5. Github will probably take you to a screen with a sample markdown file. No need to edit the file for now. Simply scroll down and hit the large green button saying `Commit Changes`.
