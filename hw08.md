## Welcome to homework 08!

This week's homework can be split into two separate goals (each with its own sub-goals):
1. Create your own gh-pages website
	a. Create a new repository
	b. Convert it to a gh-pages website
	c. Get the repository onto your local machine
	c. Populate the website
2. Further explore the mauna-loa data
	a. Clone an existing repository
	b. Begin coding on your local computer and using `.py` files
	c. Determine correlations between data in mauna-loa

*Note*: This homework assumes that you have successfully installed python and a terminal capable of running github. Completing these requirements will differ depending on your operating system, so please do this individually. That said, if you need help with this, email us!

### 1. Create your own gh-pages website

#### Part A: Creating a new Repository
Go to <a href='https://github.com' target='_blank'>GitHub</a>. If you are logged in to your github account, you should be able to create a new repository by clicking the green button as pictured below:

Once clicked, you will be given options to configure your repository.
1. Your repository must be of the format `<account-name>.github.io`. In other words, repository should include **the exact same name as your account name**. If my account name were BillyBob, my github website repository will be called `BillyBob.github.io`.

2. This should be a public repository. No need to include a `README.md`, a `.gitignore`, or to choose a license.

#### Part B: Convert the repository to gh-pages

1. Once the repository is created, you should be able to access it at the link `github.com/username/username.github.io`. If my username were `BillyBob`, the website would be `github.com/BillyBob/BillyBob.github.io`. 

2. Once at that URL, you should be able to click on the `Settings` Tab (with a gear icon).

3. In the `Settings` Tab, click on the `Pages` Icon under the `Code and Automation` section on the left of the screen.

4. Check to see if your screen matches the image below. Click on the button that says `change theme`. Choose whatever theme you like the most.

5. Github will probably take you to a screen with a sample markdown file. No need to edit the file for now. Simply scroll down and hit the large green button saying `Commit Changes`.

#### Part C: Get the repository onto your local machine

1. Go to your computer's local terminal. It should have git installed. Navigate to the desired directory, and create a new folder where you would like to create the new repository.

2. Navigate inside the folder. Type the command:

```
git init
```

After hitting enter, you should see a `.git` folder when you use the command `ls -a`.

3. **We have just initialized the git repository**. We must now **Link the local repository to the remote repository on github**.
	a. In your browser, navigate to the homepage of your `username.github.io` repository on GitHub.
	b. In the code tab, click on the `code` button (in blue) and the `copy` botton (in red) as seen below

	c. Back in your terminal, type the following command. Where it says <link here>, paste the link we copied from the github site. In BillBob's example, the link will look something like `https://github.com/BillyBob/BillyBob.github.io.git`. **Pasting the link will be different depending on your terminal**. You may only need to right click, or right click and click paste, or something else.

```
git remote add origin <link here>
``` 

4. Now that we have linked the local repository to the remote repository, **we must sync our local repository with the remote repository**. To do this, type the command below:

```
git pull origin main --rebase
```

*NOTE*: If you get an error saying `couldn't find remote ref`, this is likely because your remote branch is not called `main`. To check the name of your remote branch, go to the github site for your repository, and view the branch name at the circled location below:

Once this is done, you should see something like this:

<img src="./assets/images/rebase_output.jpg" width="200" align='center'/>

5. Now that we have synced up our repositories, we should **sync up local and remote branches (if necessary)**. This will make our lives easier as we move forward.
