## Welcome to homework 08!

There are a few main goals for this week's homework.
1. Create your own gh-pages website 
2. Make commits to your personal gh-pages website from your local computer
3. Code in python on your local computer using .py files
4. Revisit the Mauna-Loa dataset on your personal computer

*Note*: This homework assumes that you have successfully installed python and a terminal capable of running github. Completing these requirements will differ depending on your operating system, so please do this individually. That said, if you need help with this, email us!

### 1. Create your own gh-pages website

Go to <a href='https://github.com' target='_blank'>GitHub</a>. If you are logged in to your github account, you should be able to create a new repository by clicking the green button as pictured below:

Once clicked, you will be given options to configure your repository.
1. Your repository must be of the format ``<account-name>.github.io``. In other words, repository should include **the exact same name as your account name**. In my case, since my account name is AlexSath, my github website repository will be called ``AlexSath.github.io``.

2. This should be a public repository. No need to include a `README.md`, a `.gitignore`, or to choose a license.
