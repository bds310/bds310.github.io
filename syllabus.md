### Course Information

- Class Meetings: Tuesday/Thursday 2-3:20
- Office Hours/Lab: Friday (Time TBD)
- Course Web site (Weekly calendar) <https://timothylwarren.github.io/bds311/>
- Canvas site (Problem sets) <https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1819463>


### Course Description

The theory and practice underlying widely used computational methods for biological data science. Focuses on the analysis and visualization of large data sets using Python, with broad applications to genomics, ecology, and other disciplines as well as quantitiative methods for statistical inference and prediction. Topics may include image processing, time series analysis, dimensionality reduction and resampling methods. This year's course will have a special focus on analysis of emerging data related to the Covid-19 pandemic.


### Prerequisites

Introductory Biology: (BI223 or 223H)
Calculus or Discrete Math: (MTH 252 or MTH 252H or MTH 228)
Some prior programming experience (CS 161 or BOT 476)


These prerequisites can be waived with instructor permission. I strive to make the class accessible and engaging for students with varied backgrounds and interests.



### Course Objectives

At the completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Organize, visualize, and perform quantitative analysis of large biological data sets.
- Apply data science principles to real-world data sets
- Use Python as a tool for scientific computing
- Simulate and study random processes using resampling methods
- Infer and predict data relationships 
- Master version control and other methods for open, reproducible research
- Design and implement algorithms to address canonical problems in biology
- Solve problems in groups via active collaboration



### Topics (Also see [weekly calendar](./index.md))

- Using Python on the Jupyter Notebook
- Analyzing tabular data with Pandas
- Visualizing biological data
- Random processes: description and simulation
- Resampling methods for hypothesis testing
- Estimating data parameters via the bootstrap
- Testing and predicting data relationships: regression and correlation
- Version control and reproducibility with Git
- Analysis of data related to the Covid-19 pandemic



### Grading

- 75% Weekly problem sets
- 25% Participation and collaboration

### Learning Resources

There is no textbook for the class but references for recommended (and sometimes required) reading will be posted on the weekly calendar on course web site.

### Homework Submission and Late Policy

All homework will be submitted via the data hub on course canvas page. Details to follow. All assignments are due at 11:59 pm on the due date specified on the syllabus. Late homework will not be accepted.

### Course Code of Conduct (Adopted from [Carpentries](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html))


We all should strive to make our virtual classroom a welcoming, supportive environment. This involves
<ul>
    <li>Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
    <li>Respecting different viewpoints</li>
    <li>Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
    <li>Accepting constructive criticism</li>
    <li>Treating each other with grace and courtesy<li>
    </ul>



### Collaboration and Academic Dishonesty

I encourage (and will sometimes require you) to talk to others about the homework. But the work that you submit for the homework and final project must be your individual solution, implemented by you (never directly copied from other students or other sources). Rather than copying someone else's work, please ask for help!

### Statement Regarding Students with Disabilities

Accommodations for students with disabilities are determined and approved by Disability Access Services (DAS). If you, as a student, believe you are eligible for accommodations but have not obtained approval please contact DAS immediately at 541-737-4098 or at <http://ds.oregonstate.edu>. DAS notifies students and faculty members of approved academic accommodations and coordinates implementation of those accommodations. While not required, students and faculty members are encouraged to discuss details of the implementation of individual accommodations.

### Diversity Statement

Oregon State University strives to create an affirming climate for all students including underrepresented and marginalized individuals and groups. Diversity encompasses differences in age, color, ethnicity, national origin, gender, physical or mental ability, religion, socioeconomic background, veteran status, sexual orientation, and marginalized groups. We believe diversity is the synergy, connection, acceptance, and mutual learning fostered by the interaction of different human characteristics. 
Oregon State University strives to respect all religious practices. If you have religious holidays that are in conflict with any of the requirements of this class, please contact the instructor immediately so that we can make alternative arrangements.  



### Resources for Support

These are trying times. If you encounter difficulties and need assistance, it’s important to reach out. Consider discussing the situation with an instructor or academic advisor. Learn about resources that assist with wellness and academic success at <https://counseling.oregonstate.edu/reach-out-success>. If you are in immediate crisis, please contact the Crisis Text Line by texting OREGON to 741-741 or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).


### Opportunities for Student Evaluation

The online Student Evaluation of Teaching system opens to students the Wednesday of week 8 and closes the Sunday before Finals Week. Students will receive notification, instructions and the link through their ONID. They may also log into the system via Online Services. Course evaluation results are crucial as they help improve courses and the learning experience of future students. Responses are anonymous (unless a student chooses to “sign” their comments agreeing to relinquish anonymity) and unavailable to instructors until after grades have been posted. The results of scaled questions and signed comments go to both the instructor and their unit head/supervisor. Anonymous (unsigned) comments go to the instructor only. 

Additionally, there will be an opportunity for midterm evaluation.


### Attribution


Some of this course builds upon already established curricula for teaching data science and Python programming. In particular, I have relied on materials developed by [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), a nonprofit foundation where I serve as an instructor. Furthermore, I have consulted and used some materials from the [Data 8: Foundations of Data Science](http://data8.org/) and [Data 100: Principles and Techniques of Data Science](https://ds100.org/) at University of California, Berkeley
